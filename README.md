## Burger Eating
A full-stack application that acts as a compatibility-based friend finder.

## Deployment
The application is deployed to Heroku: https://radiant-cove-47298.herokuapp.com/

There may be a small delay when you first try to access the application due to the web dyno going to sleep if it receives no traffic for 30 minutes.

## How To
Enter the name of the burger you would like to eat now, or later.
The new burger will be added to either the eaten or uneaten lost depending on what button is clicked.
Uneaten burgers can be eaten at any later time. 

## Technologies Used
- HTML and handlebars
- JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js
- Express
- Path
- MySQL and JawsDB MySQL

## Incomplete Features/TODO:

- Input verification.
- Improve UI.
